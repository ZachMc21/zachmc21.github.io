Hello! This is the personal portfolio page for Zach Magloughlin.

This project is a built-from-scratch webpage that showcases previous projects and their stack and outcomes, and also functions as a second resume.

Please note: this webpage is a bit "quick and dirty." I wanted to get something together to have my projects in one place, so advanced styling and animations have been set to the side for now.

Thank you for your time!
