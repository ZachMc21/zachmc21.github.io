Hello! This is the personal portfolio page for Zach Magloughlin.

This project is a built-from-scratch webpage that showcases previous projects and their stack and outcomes, and also functions as a second resume.

Please note: this webpage is a bit "quick and dirty." I wanted to get something together to have my projects in one place, so advanced styling and animations have been set to the side for now.

Thank you for your time!

Active backlog:
- Add images, code snippets, etc. to projects
- When the user scrolls past the bottom of the page, footer background color does not continue
- Animate #skills to fade in from bottom on scroll. Elements fade in individually from left to right
- Mobile-responsive display
- Change CSS selector for `<div class="project_divider fade-in" id="end">` to select the last div of that class type
